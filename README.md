This is a School project about Web Development
but the twist is you can only use HTML and nothing else.
I'm not a complete master of HTML but i have learned quite a lot from this and since my main concept cannot have any stylung on it whatsoever, it may look a tad bit weird if you view this in a desktop/monitor. 
But it might look somewhat decent if you view this on mobile so please avoid viewing this with any wide screens to prevent your eyes burning from this monstrosity of a code
